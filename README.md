### What is Spoti-Disco?
Spoti-Disco is a site for EDM music enthusiasts to quickly see what events are coming their way and check out the music at the same time. Users can also save their favorite artists to come back to anytime.

### Do users need to make an account?
No, Spoti-Disco will store all the saved artists and link them to a session ID. This means that all the user needs to do is return to the site using the same browser (assuming that cookies aren't being deleted and it's not a private browser).

### How do users purchase tickets to the event?
Links to the TicketMaster purchase page are provided for all events. Additionally, links to all artists' YouTube channel are provided to make it easy to check out more music.
